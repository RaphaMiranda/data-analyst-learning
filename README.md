### Data Analyst Notes

* Data Types:
- Categorical
    - Nominal > Naming or labelling variables (Qualitative)
    - Ordinal > Categorical data with an order (Very Happy, Happy, Ok, Unhappy, sad)
- Numerical (Discrete or Continous)
    - Interval > It measures variables on a continuous scale (has an arbitrary zero point (e.g., 0 degrees Celsius))
    - Ratio > Same as Interval but has a True Zero (0 kg, it's the absence of the variable)

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive data analysis looks at past data and tells what
happened. This is often used when tracking Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), revenue, sales leads, and more.

- Simpler Interpretation of data
- More meaningful than raw data

1. Central Tendency
    - Mean > 
    - Median > The middle term of a series
    - Mode > The value that has most observations
2. Spread/Dispersion
    - Range > Boundaries of the dataset
    - Variance > How far each number are from the mean
    - Standard Deviation > Measures dispertion from individual data values to the mean  
    - IQR > Inter Quartile Range : Q1, Q2, Q3 - represents the range between q1 and q3
    - Standard error of the means

### Visualizations

- Categorical Data Visualization
1. Pie Chart
2. Bar Chart

- Constinuous Data Visualization
1. Boxplot - 
2. Histogram - Frequency Distribution

### Probabilities
- Helps makes statements about how much confidence we have in estimates
- Experiment : Situation that you are not sure about it
- Outcome: Result of a single trial
- Event: 
- Probability (0-1)
- Sample Space: Contains all the possible outcomes of the experiment
- P(Success) vs. P(Failure) = 1-P(S)


### Distributions
- It's a table, function or a graph that describes all possible values for a variable and how often the occur.
- Describes grouping or density of observations
- Could it be discretes or Continuous

### Bernoulli Distribution
- 2 Possible outcomes
- Success or failure

### Normal Distribution
The normal Distribution could be described completely by mean and standard deviation.
- Central Theorem Limit

### Characterization of Data
- Location, Variability, Skewness (assimetria), Kurtosis (Afunilamento)
